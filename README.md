# OTAR-BioCypher

This is a port of the Open Targets knowledge graph dump (available at http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/various/ot_graphdb/current/) to BioCypher. It is very much work in progress. To run, clone the repository into the same parent directory as the main BioCypher repository (https://github.com/saezlab/BioCypher), which is a required development dependency. Once you have clones of both repositories and a working installation of the Poetry dependency manager, run `poetry install` from the `OTAR-BioCypher` root directory.

Once successfully installed, porting the OTAR graph can be attempted by running a local (or remotely accesssible) instance of the OTAR graph dump in Neo4j and executing the Python script at `port/script.py`. This will connect to BioCypher using the adapter (from `adapter.py`) and write the BioCypher-compatible structured data to the `biocypher-out` directory. You can find a version of the neo4j-admin import command for the processed data in each individual output folder, under the file name `neo4j-admin-import-call.sh`, which simply needs to be executed in the home directory of the target database. More information about the BioCypher package can be found at https://saezlab.github.io/BioCypher/.
